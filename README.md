# re-learn

**Learn them good**

Data-driven tutorials for reagent components with no changes required to your dom.

![](documentation/re-learn.gif?raw=true)

## Why?

Well-designed UIs are intuitive but even the best may need to introduce new features or train new users.
Descriptions should be close to the element they are describing, both on screen and in your code.

Existing tutorial solutions rely on hooks into and mutation of your dom which does not work with React. Defining lessons separately from your code makes them subject to rot as behaviour changes and documentation is not updated.

re-learn allows you to describe lessons for your UI elements with data and generates walk-throughs for your users. It does not mutate your dom, making it React-friendly, and by writing the lesson write next to the code it describes you stand a better chance of keeping it up-to-date.

Versioning allows you to update descriptions when behaviour changes or is enhanced, ensuring that all your users are kept up-to-date with all the awesome features you're adding to your application.

## Usage

Annotate reagent render functions with lessons

```clojure
(require [re-learn.core :as re-learn]
         [re-learn.utils :as rlu])

(def purchase-button
  (rlu/with-lesson
    {:id :purchase-button-lesson
     :description "When you're ready, click here to purchase"
     :position :bottom         ;; optional, defaults to :right. values are :left, :right, :bottom, :unattached and :top (experimental)
     :version 2                ;; optional, defaults to 1
     :attach [:button#some-id] ;; optional, attach lesson to a dommy selector, see https://github.com/plumatic/dommy for use
     :continue [:table :.tr]   ;; optional, continue when this dommy selector is clicked
     }

    (fn [] [:button.mdl-button.mdl-button--raised "Purchase"])))
```

Combine lessons into tutorials and attach them to views

```clojure
(def checkout
  (rlu/with-tutorial
    {:id :checkout-tutorial
     :lessons [{:id :welcome-lesson                              ;; this is an inline lesson, not attached to anything
                :description "Welcome to the re-learn example"}
               basket
               totals
               purchase-button]}

    (fn [app-state]
      [:div
       [basket app-state]
       [purchase-button]])))
```

Let re-learn take care of everything else!

```clojure
(defn- init []
  (let [app-root (js/document.getElementById "app")
        tutorial-root (js/document.getElementById "tutorial")
        app-state (fn [] ...)
    (reagent/render [checkout app-state] app-root)
    (reagent/render [re-learn/tutorial-view] tutorial-root)))
```

[Look at the working example](example/checkout/app.cljs) for more details.

## Development

```clojure
user> (dev)
dev> (start)
;; visit http://localhost:3449
dev> (cljs)
cljs.user>
```

## To do
- Can unlearn individual tutorials rather than unlearning everything
- Live demo
